since ancient debris has no block tag (only mineable by pickaxe and use diamond tool) so I use require diamod tools tags and the block that can use to plant netherite tree is more than one and I was trying to find a resolution of it
the planter blocks are
  - ancient debris
  - obsidian
  - crying obsidian
  - netherite block
  - respawn anchor
 and imagine plant the most OP tree with only the obsidian lmao
